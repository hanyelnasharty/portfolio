                <p>My name is Hany Elnasharty, and I'm passionate about technology. Recently, I've been focusing on developing my programming skills professionally. However, I'm no stranger to the world of tech; I've dabbled in it through self-study in the past. With a finance background and having attended business school, I've always been analytical and detail-oriented, which has been reflected in my academic and professional life.<br/><br/> Throughout college, I successfully maintained a good work-life balance while pursuing both work and studies. I'm constantly on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to advance myself. My recent interest in tech began with basic learning at Code Academy. After discovering the benefits of coding bootcamps and their practical knowledge and career coaching, I decided to enroll full-time at General Assembly to maximize the benefits of their intensive training. I'm excited to embark on a new, long, and successful chapter in my life.</p>
